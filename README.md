# Google Summer of Code ideas for Perl projects

![TPF](img/tpf_logo_transparent.png){:align="right" width="300px"}


The Perl Foundation participates in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2019.
This page lists project ideas for Perl and its related projects.

Google offers some very good documentation for Summer of Code. If you haven't already you should really
[head over to it](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Make sure you don't miss

- [How it works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)
- the [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)
- and the [Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)

We encourage you to get in contact with our mentors and the Perl community in general as early as possible.
Talking with the mentors about the projects you are interested in is the fastest way to get a good
understanding of the project idea. And that is the most important step for a good application and
successful project.

Each project idea lists the mentors with their contact information.
In general the Perl 6 community is most active on IRC. Just drop by on [#perl6](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=perl6&nick=) and say hello!
The Perl 5 community is best reached via the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tpf-gsoc-students) but also active on [IRC](https://www.irc.perl.org/) (join `#soc-help` on irc.perl.org).

If you have a project idea not listed below but fitting under the Perl umbrella, feel free to contact us
and we'll see what we can do.
