Adding ideas
------------

To add project ideas create a pull request for this repository.
Just copy the [project idea template](project_template.md) into the perl5 or perl6 directory (or create a new one if it does not fit exactly in any of them) and fill it out. Use a separate file for each project idea.
Please also add your project idea to the *Project ideas* list above, itemized. If you have an idea but no mentor or the idea is not entirely fleshed out, add it to *incomplete project ideas* and try to complete it. Ideas without a mentor will have to be removed before this list is submitted to Google.

Project ideas need to meet certain criteria described [on this Google page](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list). When you use the template you should be good to go. If you have an idea and want to discuss it before adding anything, [discuss it here or add a new issue](https://github.com/perl-gsoc-2019/ideas/issues/8)
