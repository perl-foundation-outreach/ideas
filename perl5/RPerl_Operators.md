RPerl Operators
===============

Description
-----------

Perl is an "operator rich" language, and the RPerl compiler still needs to implement most of the builtin Perl operators.

The process of implementing RPerl operators is documented here:

[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/blob/master/docs/devs_getting_started.txt)


Expected outcomes
-----------------

We must implement at least one RPerl operator, including tests to ensure the operator is functioning properly.

An example operator can be found here:

[Exp.pm](https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/blob/master/lib/RPerl/Operation/Expression/Operator/Named/Exp.pm)

The corresponding tests can be found here:

[Operator01NamedExp](https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/tree/master/lib/RPerl/Test/Operator01NamedExp)


Required skills
---------------

Students must possess basic programming skills in both Perl and C++.
